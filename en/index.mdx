## Global Overview

**MetaQare** is more than a platform — it’s the new digital infrastructure for healthcare. 
Building on the limitations of traditional health systems, MetaQare brings together:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for diagnostics, triage, and care automation.
- **Blockchain** for traceability, e‑prescriptions, reimbursements, and governance.
- **24/7 Telemedicine** with our own network or integrated third‑party networks.
- **FHIR Interoperability** enabling direct integration with systems such as REMPE, SEOGA, or insurer CRMs.

MetaQare aligns with the main global trends described in leading reports on the future of digital health (2023–2025).

> "63% of Europeans would be willing to consult a doctor outside their country through digital platforms." — Eurobarometer, 2022

> "Interoperable FHIR + AI environments have demonstrated a 35% increase in diagnostic efficiency." — WEF HealthTech Outlook, 2024

## Global Challenges

Healthcare systems worldwide face:

- **Unequal access and geography as a barrier**
- **Outdated infrastructure and disconnected systems**
- **Administrative burdens that overwhelm clinicians**
- **Lack of follow‑up, prevention, and continuity of care**

MetaQare addresses these inefficiencies with an accessible, interoperable, and secure system that puts people at the center.
