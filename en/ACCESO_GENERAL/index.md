# General Access | MetaQare Manual

Welcome to the **MetaQare** ecosystem — the first fully interoperable, decentralized, and user‑centered digital health system. 
This section serves as a general introduction to the architecture, philosophy, and scope of the MetaQare project, 
and is the starting point for all user profiles: patients, insurers, clinicians, and administrators.

## Global Vision

**MetaQare** is more than a platform — it is the new healthcare infrastructure for the 21st century. 
Designed to solve the inefficiencies, overload, and fragmentation of traditional health systems, MetaQare combines:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for diagnostics, triage, and care automation.
- **Blockchain** for traceability, e‑prescriptions, reimbursements, and governance.
- **24/7 Telemedicine** with its own network or integration with third parties.
- **FHIR Interoperability** allowing direct integration with systems such as REMPE, SEOGA, or insurer CRMs.

MetaQare aligns with the main global trends described by McKinsey, Deloitte, HIMSS, and the World Economic Forum in their reports on the future of digital healthcare (2023–2025).
